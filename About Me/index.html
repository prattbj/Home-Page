    <p>Hello. I am a software engineering major who is interested in 
        making music software, such as virtual synthesizers.
        I enjoy producing electronic music and I also play video games.
        I am single and do not currently work. I really love the campus
        here at BYUI. I am working towards a Bachelor's degree.
    </p>
    <p>Learning about web design is important because for just about
        any career, there is a need for a website, as the internet is
        a big part of everybody's lives. If I end up developing my own
        music software, I will need to know how to create a website so
        that people can find my software and download it.
    </p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church for my entire life, 20 years.
        My favorite scripture is Helamen 5:12. It is a bit long, but it
        is about how we need to build our testimony on our Redeemer, as
        if we do, our testimony will be a foundation that will keep us 
        from falling due to trials.
    </p>
    <p>An interesting thing about me is that I have lived in Brazil,
        India, and El Salvador. I grew up in Minnesota but moved abroad
        after my father joined the Foreign Service and became a diplomat.
        I hope we can all enjoy learning web development together!
    </p>
